This is a client side employee manager that lets you view, hire, and even fire your pesky employees with just the touch of a button. I used MySQL2 and javascript 
to configure this item

To run this just download the code to your system and run 'ode index.js' in your inline command terminal

Once you run it you are given a questionaire screen which gives you one of many different options.
